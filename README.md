#Binary Search Trees (BST) 🌳💻
Binary Search Trees (BSTs) are a fundamental data structure in computer science, commonly used for efficient searching and sorting of data. Let's dive into what they are, how they work, and why they are so useful! 🧑‍💻📚

What is a Binary Search Tree? 🤔
A Binary Search Tree is a type of binary tree where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. The BST has a specific property:
Left Subtree: All nodes in the left subtree have values less than the value of the parent node.
Right Subtree: All nodes in the right subtree have values greater than the value of the parent node.
This property makes BSTs incredibly efficient for searching, insertion, and deletion operations.
Key Operations 🚀
1. Insertion 🪄
To insert a value in a BST:
Start at the root.
Compare the value to be inserted with the current node.
If the value is less, move to the left child; if greater, move to the right child.
Repeat until you find an empty spot where the new value can be inserted.
Example:
Inserting the value 15 into a BST:
markdown
Copy code
       20
       /  \
      10   30
     /  \
    5    15

Compare 15 with 20 (go left).
Compare 15 with 10 (go right).
Insert 15 as the right child of 10.
2. Searching 🔍
To search for a value in a BST:
Start at the root.
Compare the value with the current node.
If it matches, you've found the value!
If it's less, move to the left child; if greater, move to the right child.
Repeat until you find the value or reach a leaf node.
Example:
Searching for the value 30 in the above BST:
Compare 30 with 20 (go right).
Compare 30 with 30 (match found!).
3. Deletion 🗑️
Deleting a node in a BST has three cases:
Leaf Node: Simply remove the node.
One Child: Remove the node and link its parent to its child.
Two Children: Find the in-order successor (the smallest value in the right subtree), replace the node's value with the in-order successor's value, and delete the successor.
Example:
Deleting the value 10 from the BST:
markdown
Copy code
       20
       /  \
      15   30
     /    
    5    

Replace 10 with its in-order successor 15.
Remove the node 15 from its original position.
Why Use Binary Search Trees? 🌟
BSTs provide efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations with an average time complexity of O(log n). This efficiency makes them ideal for applications like databases and file systems where quick data retrieval is crucial.
Visual Representation 🎨
Here's a simple visual representation of a BST:
markdown
Copy code
       50
       /  \
     30   70
    / \   / \
  20 40 60 80

Root: 50
Left Subtree: Values less than 50 (20, 30, 40)
Right Subtree: Values greater than 50 (60, 70, 80)
Conclusion 📝
Binary Search Trees are a powerful tool in computer science, providing efficient ways to manage and organise data. By understanding their structure and operations, you can leverage BSTs to improve the performance of your applications. Happy coding! 🚀
