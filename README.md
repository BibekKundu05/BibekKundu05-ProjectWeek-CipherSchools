# 🌳✨ Binary Search Tree Visualizer ✨🌳


Welcome to the Binary Search Tree Visualizer! 🎉 This interactive tool lets you visualize and manipulate a Binary Search Tree (BST) right in your browser. Whether you're a student learning about data structures, a teacher explaining tree operations, or just a coding enthusiast, this visualizer is for you! 🚀

## 🌟 Features 🌟
🔧 Insert Node: Easily add new nodes to the BST.

🗑️ Remove Node: Delete nodes and see the tree adjust.

🔍 Search: Find nodes with specific values.

🔽 Find Min/Max: Quickly identify the smallest and largest values in the tree.

🔄 Traversals: Perform and visualize Preorder, Inorder, and Postorder traversals.

♻️ Reset Tree: Clear the current tree and start fresh.

## 🛠️ Getting Started 🛠️
Follow these steps to get the visualizer running on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/BibekKundu05/ProjectWeek-CipherSchools.git

### 2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd BST-Visualizer

### 3. Open index.html in your favorite web browser:

open index.html

or just double-click the file in your file explorer.

#### That's it! You're ready to start visualizing BSTs! 🌐

## 🤖 How It Works 🤖
This project is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses the binary-tree-visualizer library to handle the drawing of the tree. The main components include:

HTML: Structure of the visualizer interface.
CSS: Styling for a sleek and dark theme.
JavaScript: Logic for BST operations and visualization updates.

### 🔧 Insert Node
Click the Insert Node button to add a new node. Enter the value in the input field, and watch as the node appears in the correct position in the tree.

### 🗑️ Remove Node
Select the node you want to remove by entering its value, then click the Remove Node button. The tree will automatically reconfigure itself to maintain the BST properties.

### 🔍 Search Node
Enter the value you're searching for and hit the Search button. The visualizer will highlight the node if it exists in the tree.

### 🔽 Find Min/Max
Click Find Min to see the smallest value in the tree, and Find Max to see the largest. The results are displayed in the output area.

### 🔄 Traversals
Explore different tree traversals:

1. Preorder Traversal: Nodes are visited in the order of root, left subtree, right subtree.

2. Inorder Traversal: Nodes are visited in the order of left subtree, root, right subtree.
3. 
Postorder Traversal: Nodes are visited in the order of left subtree, right subtree, root.

### ♻️ Reset Tree
Click the Reset Tree button to clear the current tree and start over.
